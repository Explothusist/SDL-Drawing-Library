# SDL-Drawing-Library

This is a C++ SDL3 library which wraps the more complex parts of the basic drawing with the SDL framework in an easy to use system modelled after the JavaScript Canvas. For examples of use, see Explothusist/Detonation-Emulation-v2.

This library requires SDL3 to build and run. It expects to find SDL3, SDL3_image, and SDL3_ttf at /x86_64-w64-mingw32/include. Any .exe files compiled using this library will also need SDL3.dll, SDL3_image.dll, and SDL3_ttf.dll to run.

The library has a Makefile which can be run from the including project's Makefile or on its own.
